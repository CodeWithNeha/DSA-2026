# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my **DSA Practice Repository** 🎯
This repo contains **only code files**, organized **day-wise**, as part of my structured DSA preparation starting from **Day 1** and moving towards **FAANG / product-based company interviews**.

---

## 📌 Why this Repository?

This repository is created to:

* Build **strong DSA fundamentals** through hands-on coding
* Practice **problem-solving daily** with consistency
* Write **clean, optimized, interview-ready code**
* Track progress in a **day-wise structured manner**
* Serve as revision material before interviews

> ✨ *Less theory, more implementation.*

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* ✅ Code-first learning
* ✅ Start with brute force → optimize
* ✅ Focus on logic & edge cases
* ✅ Analyze **Time & Space Complexity** in mind
* ✅ Write readable and maintainable code

* Each folder represents **one day of DSA practice**
* Each file contains **one problem with its solution**
* File names reflect the **problem or concept**

---

## 📅 Day 1 – DSA Basics

### Focus Areas:

* Time Complexity (Big-O basics)
* Space Complexity
* Arrays fundamentals
* Indexing & traversal
* Simple problem-solving patterns

> Goal: Build intuition and confidence with basic problems.

---

## 🛠️ Language Used

* **Primary Language:** Python 🐍
  (Readable, interview-friendly, and logic-focused)

> Concepts are applicable across all programming languages.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Roadmap

* Arrays & Strings
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Linked List
* Stack & Queue
* Hashing
* Two Pointers & Sliding Window
* Binary Search
* Trees & BST
* Heaps
* Graphs
* Dynamic Programming

---

## 🧪 How to Use This Repo

1. Open the current **Day folder**
2. Pick a problem file
3. Try to understand the approach
4. Think about edge cases & optimizations
5. Revisit older days for revision

---

## 🌱 Consistency Note

> 📌 *One day. One folder. Better logic every day.*

This repository is about **showing discipline and growth**, not perfection.

Happy Coding! 💻🔥
